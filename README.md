# Black to Color

### Google Chrome Extension - Grayscale websites convert into color mode

The story behind that:
Because of Thai people so loved their King, so after His death many thai
services/websites are converted into grayscale mode. It is very annoying,
especially when you try to work with this sevices.

This strict change was only for a month during a mourning period from October 13, 2016 till November 13, 2016. At the moment all websites/services changed back in notmal (colorfull) mode.
